                    <h1>Why this website?</h1>

                    <p>The main idea consists in proposing travels suggestions with practical information (price, how to pay less, what are the alternatives to do this etc). It is therefore mainly a travels blog, but I don't exclude to write down some articles about different topics later. The objective is also personal : I wanted to code my website and not use a pre-conceived blog (besides my personal satisfaction to make this project from A to Z, it allows me to customize the most possible my website). Writing permits to take a global view on the travels done.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    This website will gather the steps of my travels done in South of America. I had the opportunity to leave 55 days with Carolina my girlfriend, between Ushuaia (Tierra del Fuego) until Lima, Peru's capital. First articles will mention this adventure. At the same time, I'll speak about all the regions in Brasil we discovered (São Paulo, Bahia, Pernambuco, Mato grosso do Sul, Parana, Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina), and especially the city of Rio de Janeiro. The "marvelous city", where I've been living will still have secrets for me, and describe all his aspects would be pretentious. Nethertheless I'll try de speak about all the "classic" attractions (Corcovado, Sugar Loaf, Lapa...) and also the hard-to-get-at locations that will lead you to amazing points of view (Dois Irmãos, Pedra da Gavea, Morro dos Cabritos)...
                    </p>

                    <h1>For who?</h1>

                    <p>Everybody is welcome : travel lovers, yound and old people...</p>

                    <h1>To sum up</h1>

                    <p>Thanks for you visit, don't hesitate to take a look sometimes because I'll add articles regularly! I would like to thank Carolina and Marianna who helped me a lot to translate every text in different langages so the blog is accessible for more people.</p>

                    <h1>About the author</h1>
                    <p>My name is Emmanuel, I'm a 22 year-old french guy. I'm currently studying computering engineering in France.</p>
                    <p>My travel's passion is not innate, though my parents made me travel a lot, mostly in Europ when I was younger. This taste for adventure and discovery appeared during my exchange year in Brasil.
                    <h1>Why ManuZinho?</h1>

                    <p>Manuzinho litterarly means "Little Manu" (as Ronaldinho means little Ronaldo). I started to write this blog while I was doing an exchange in Rio de Janeiro, and I've loved this portuguese langage concept which can transform almost any word in something bigger or smaller (cervejinha -> cerveja -> cervejão).
